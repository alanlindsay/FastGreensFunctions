Fast integral methods for Green's functions.

Matlab codes to demonstrate boundary integral solution of planar Neumann Green's functions. The function NeumR_2D returns the Greens function planar Green's function either interior or exterior to a planar curve. 

The description of the methods and convergence stuides can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08458

The implemntaiton utilizes the boundary integral package chunkIE, available at https://chunkie.readthedocs.io
